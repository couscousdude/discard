# dis**card**

not just another flashcards app.

## What is it?

discard (stylized dis**card**, and always lowercase) is a free (as in freedom) tool for creating smarter "flashcards."
Go beyond just flipping through definitions and supercharge your cards with the power of AI.
discard is fully open-source and hackable. It's not meant to replace Quizlet as a flashcard maker,
but instead provide a starting point for you to hack as you see fit into a custom studying tool, for any use case.

## Tech stack

discard's core tech stack is Svelte + SvelteKit. Svelte is a new web framework which offloads most of the overhead associated with web frameworks to the compile step, leaving you with a tiny bundle size (oftentimes less than just the size of `react` and `react-dom`)!

## How do I use it?

discard does not itself provide any service. Instead, it's meant to be a site that you
hack yourself to add your cards and features. This assumes you have a basic knowledge of TypeScript and Svelte.
At the most basic level, you can simply replace the placeholder cards with your own.
